## Summary

This project covers all the techniques and elements I masterd during the processing on a Machine Learning research. 

The main goal of this project is to classify human facial expressions and depict them to emojis. We build a convolution neural network to recognize facial emotions. Then we will map those emotions with the corresponding catoons, emojis or avatars.

# Goal

Create your own emoji with Deep Learning
